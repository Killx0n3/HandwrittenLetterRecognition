# Handwritten Letter Recognition
## A Machine Learning (ML) program using Python which can recognise hand-written letters.

### About
In this project we are working with a large number of black-and-white rectangular pixel displays. We will use neural networks (MLP) and KNN in order to predict which of the 26 capital letters in the English alphabet each such display represents.

The character images is based on 20 different fonts and each letter within these 20 fonts has been randomly distorted to produce a file of 20,000 unique stimuli. Each stimulus was converted into 16 primitive numerical attributes (statistical moments and edge counts) which were then scaled to fit into a range of integer values from 0 through 15. We typically train on the first 16000 items and then use the resulting model to predict the letter category for the remaining 4000 (NOT done in this project).
